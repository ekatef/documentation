    "## Guideline to extend the model to other regions\n",
    "\n",
    "There are certain things we would recommend when you think about extending the model to another region. To help you progressing fast, we created this guideline.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Debug from the root of rules**\n",
    "\n",
    "The snakemake workflow can be imagines as tree. It has roots (rules without dependencies), that streamline over the tree trunk (rules that have dependencies) towards it's crown (rules with no following one). In our example the crown is the optimized network. As you cannot build a house starting with the roof of a house, you should make sure that you build it up from the bottom. So debug from bottom up, from rules without dependencies towards the rules which dependencies you already debugged and until you deserve the crown.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use global data as default**\n",
    "\n",
    "The first time you extend the model to another region, you should use global data and contribute code in harmony with PyPSA-Africa code. It means, the PyPSA-Africa code grows slowly towards the PyPSA-Earth code. While global data might be sometimes less accurate, it has the great benefit that we stay one community that can build on each others developments. In this sense, **we try to build one code base** that works across the Earth so that your developments help everyone. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Create linkers for country specific data**\n",
    "\n",
    "The default data might be not always enough for your study purpose. We would encourage you to **create linkers** to replace the global default by the new more accurate data and contribute these linkers to the GitHub repository. For instance, you model North Africa, but have more accurate national weather data available for Egypt. While you use the global default data for all countries you could replace the Egyptian data with the linker. This linkers are not yet developed or tested (01.12.21) - but we have ideas on how to design them. Maybe it's an opportunity for a great contributions? \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Python first for fast developments. Understanding the bottlenecks**\n",
    "\n",
    "Some people consider Python as slow. **Compiler speed is not really a bottleneck for us**. For instance, building the sector-coupled model in Europe from bottom up (executing all rules) takes about 10-15min, while solving a large optimization problem can take between 12-36 hours. What we really need is to develop as community fast, new and better features. Limiting the coding languages for all workflows to Python helps people with fast and easy to understand developments."

Some examples are: OpenStreetMap (osm) data, downloaded by the rule `download_osm_data` or the GADM shapes, by the rule `build_shapes`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other data sometimes cannot be automatically downloaded from the original source, instead, we prepared a databundle (zip files) that is automatically downloaded from google drive. **However, this databundle has been tested for Africa and may be incomplete for other regions**. The input data contained in these files are those where attention should be put when the user is interested into investigating different regions\n",

    "\n",
    "### 2.2. Folder `data/raw`\n",
    "\n",
    "- `data/raw/hydrobasins`: in this folder the data about the shapes of watershed boundaries and basins are provided, but the current file in the databundle is Africa-specific. Data for other regions are available from [HydroBASINS](https://www.hydrosheds.org/page/hydrobasins). These data shall be calibrated when hydro resource is used.\n",
    "- `data/raw/landcover`: data for Africa-only have been downloaded to reduce the needed space; these files shall be changed according to the areas of interest. Data downloaded from the following [link](https://www.protectedplanet.net/en/thematic-areas/wdpa?tab=WDPA)\n",
    "\n",

    "- `data/raw/GDP`: data already with global scope\n",
    "- `data/raw/gebco`: data already with global scope\n",
    "- `data/raw/worldpop`: data automatically downloaded from build_shapes rule\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3. Folder `resources`\n",
    "\n",
    "The resources folder contains main inputs for the resource and load estimation.\n",

    "No changes are expected; except for the demand data, all the other files are generated automatically by the workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4. Folder `cutouts`\n",
    "\n",
    "The folder `cutouts` contains the cutouts files that contains timeseries of the renewable production for the region of interest, which are generated using [Atlite](https://github.com/PyPSA/atlite).\n",
    "Currently, after you download the data from the google drive, you can find a pre-compiled file already built for Africa, for simplicity; however, if a different region shall be investigated, then the file has to be generated for the specific region.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do so, it is possible enable the rule `build_cutout`, which automatically generates the cutout for the selected regions by using Atlite. Enabling it and downloading the data can take 1-2 days for a continent depending on the status of the server. To enable the rule, you shall go into the `config.yaml` file and change the corresponding boolean value in the `enable` section\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "enable:\n",
    "  build_cutout: true\n",

    "- installed the [Copernicus Climate Data Store](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu) `cdsapi` package  (`install with pip`) and\n",
    "- registered and setup your CDS API key as described [on their website](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api-how-to);\n",
    "  the CDS API allows an automatic filedownload by executing this script\n",
    "\n",
    "**Once the build_cutout has been executed, we recommend to disable it, once the files have been generated.** Be aware that the cutouts file are very large 10-20GB for 1 continent."
